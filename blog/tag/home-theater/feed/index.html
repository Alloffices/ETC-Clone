				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dedicated home theater space is no longer a requirement for a home theater.</strong> In fact, the new outdoor theater screens are almost completely customizable and feature all the new technology available inside your home but now can be placed almost anywhere outside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bottom-Image-1300.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-856" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bottom-Image-1300-300x192.jpg" alt="Bottom-Image-1300" width="300" height="192" srcset="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bottom-Image-1300-300x192.jpg 300w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bottom-Image-1300-1024x655.jpg 1024w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bottom-Image-1300.jpg 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>We especially like the <a href="http://stealthacoustics.com/stealth-patio-theater/">Stealth Home Theater</a> systems.</strong> It features LED screens, outdoor loud speakers (with new processing systems like Dolby Atmos) and the option to customize screen specifications for placement in brighter lighting including the ability to adjust the resolution and brightness. And the screens can be placed almost anywhere because of the enclosure system that will protect the screen when not in use. And an added bonus, these systems play Blu-ray movies, digital files, files stored on a network or in a cloud, cable or satellite, as well as streaming systems like Roku, Amazon Fire, Netflix, and Apple TV.</p>
<p><strong>The customization of the screen and versatility of streaming sources make this theater system an easy solution for families looking for more entertainment options outside</strong><strong>.  </strong>Interested in planning an outdoor theater for your home?  We are happy to help!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A few members of our staff attended CEDIA 2014 in Denver, CO this month.</strong> It was an outstanding show.  They talked to some new vendors, met with some of our go-to vendors and saw some awesome product demos. Here are six new products and technologies presented at CEDIA 2014 to get excited about.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/145519.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-787" alt="145519" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/145519-300x231.jpg" width="300" height="231" srcset="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/145519-300x231.jpg 300w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/145519.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1. </strong><b>New 4K TV Choices</b>. LG is now offering 98- and 105-inch 4K UHD LED LCD TVs through special distribution arrangements with custom installers. <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lg-electronics-expands-ultra-hd-tv-lineup-led-by-105--and-98-inch-tvs-introduced-at-cedia-expo-274818981.html">Read more</a> about the new UHD TVs available November 2014.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dolby-atmos.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-788" alt="dolby atmos" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dolby-atmos-300x166.jpg" width="300" height="166" srcset="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dolby-atmos-300x166.jpg 300w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dolby-atmos.jpg 301w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>2. </strong><b>Dolby Atmos</b>. New surround sound demos were hosted by several companies and they were very impressive.  Adding Dolby Atmos to personal home theaters will provide the type of surround sound that was only available in commercial theaters.  <a href="http://www.cepro.com/article/kef_r50_speaker_addresses_dolby_atmos_surround_sound_configurations/K536">Read more</a> about Dolby Atmos technology for your home theater here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Netflix-4K.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-796" alt="Netflix 4K" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Netflix-4K.jpg" width="275" height="183" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3. 4K </strong><b>Ultra High Definition Content Options Increase</b>. Netflix already provides streaming of native UHD programming.  During the CEDIA conference, Sony president Mike Fasulo revealed that Amazon Prime Instant Video will soon be offering 4K content. Sony has also made its 4K media player compatible with other brands of 4K UHD sets for direct 4K movie downloads, providing new content options.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/images6LKLTHFK.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-789" alt="images6LKLTHFK" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/images6LKLTHFK-300x163.jpg" width="300" height="163" srcset="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/images6LKLTHFK-300x163.jpg 300w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/images6LKLTHFK.jpg 304w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><b>Kaleidescape Increases Streaming Movie Options</b>.  Kaleidescape entered into a license agreement with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment making their entire catalog of movies available for download in true Blu-ray quality.  Another big plus is the HD downloads are identical to Blu-ray including audio tracks which means Kaleidescape maybe the first (for now) only cloud-based format to deliver uncompressed Atmos soundtracks to your home theater.  <a href="http://www.cepro.com/article/cedia_2014_how_kaleidescape_will_stay_relevant_with_content_4k_cost/">Read more.</a></p>

<p><strong>5. </strong><b>Leon Speakers</b>. The new Leon custom speaker bar is outstanding, slimmer, cleaner looking, more powerful and versatile.  Leon also broadened their product line and unveiled new off-the-shelf speakers that are available at a very competitive price. <a href="http://www.cepro.com/article/leon_speakers_gets_serious_with_lx_line_but_expect_surprises_with_classic/leon_speakers">Read more</a> about Leon Speakers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Looking into updating your home to take full advantage of the latest technology that helps make life a bit simpler?</strong>  Planning to build a home and want to have your security system integrated with the automated lighting system and a family room that turns into home theater at the touch of a button?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/crestron_TSW_550_med.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-542" title="crestron_TSW_550_med" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/crestron_TSW_550_med-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/crestron_TSW_550_med-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/crestron_TSW_550_med.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Before you meet with a custom electronics professional, the people that make all the magic happen, it pays to have a little knowledge of the industry before you start. </strong> Like in any new endeavor, cooking, sailing, or golf lessons, it pays to know the lingo, and home automation is no different.</p>
<p>Lisa Montgomery, a writer for Electronic House magazine, compiled a great list of the “10 Most Misunderstood Terms” used by the pros.  Read over this list so you will have a better idea of what you will be discussing.</p>
<p><strong>1. Macro:</strong> A macro is a very good thing to have. It allows you to touch one button to initiate multiple commands to a variety of different devices rather than pecking at several individual buttons to accomplish the same task. Macros can set the lights, music and thermostats in the dining room for a dinner party, arrange the environment for a movie in the home theater … anything else that would typically require the adjustment of several devices through a variety of controls.</p>
<p><strong>2. GUI:</strong> Short for Graphic User Interface. The term refers to any type of device that’s used control the electronic devices in your home. A GUI can be an iPhone, an iPad, a touch panel, a remote control or something else.</p>
<p><strong>3. Scenes:</strong> A scene is much like a macro, but it a term used mainly when describing how a group of light fixtures responds to a single command from a remote, touch panel, etc. A lighting scene could involve the brightening and dimming of several fixtures in a room to evoke a mood like romantic, party or evening drama, or to complement a certain activity like breakfast, goodnight or welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>4. Architectural:</strong> In the custom electronics industry, architectural commonly refers to a type of loudspeaker; specifically, one that can be mounted flush with the wall or ceiling surface.</p>
<p><strong>5. Acoustically Transparent:</strong> This term usually refers to a type of screen sometimes used in a home theater or media room. It is designed to display images projected onto it from a video projector, but unlike other projection screens its fabric has tiny, indiscernible holes that allow sound from speakers positioned behind it to filter unaffected into the room. They are a popular choice of homeowners who want a clean, uncluttered look in their home theaters.</p>
<p><strong>6. Bright:</strong> When an installer says a room is “bright,” he means that there may be too many hard surfaces (wood floors, windows, marble countertops, etc.) for an audio system to perform its best. Sound that’s broadcast from speakers in a bright room can bounce harshly off the hard surfaces, making it difficult to hear dialogue in a movie or understand the lyrics of a song. A custom electronics pro can solve this issue by adding soft materials (draperies, rugs or special acoustical treatments) to the room.</p>
<p><strong>7. Presets:</strong> Most home automation systems must be programmed by a professional to react in a certain way when they receive a signal from something – a timer, a button press, a motion sensor, etc. This cause-and-effect process is what’s known as a preset. For example, your CE pro might program a preset that tells the home automation system to open the motorized drapes at a certain time of day.</p>
<p><strong>8. Scalable:</strong> A “scalable” automation system is one that can be easily reconfigured (usually to perform additional tasks) to meet the needs of its users. Scalability is a feature you should always look for in an automation system.</p>
<p><strong>9. Compatible:</strong> When you’re compatible with someone, you just naturally “mesh.” The same is true of a home automation system and the many diverse components it can control. In the home technology, manufacturers and custom electronics professional strive for as much compatibility between products as possible. Sometimes this is accomplished by the manufacturer; other times, the CE pro finds a way to get two incompatible components to communicate openly with each other. When all parts of a system are compatible, it typically works better and is easier to use.</p>
<p><strong>10. Integration:</strong> This is the process of making all elements of a home automation system working together seamlessly, as though they were one unit. When a custom electronics professional says he specialized in “integration” (many of them do), he will know how to tie new components into your old whole-house music system or make your home’s thermostats work with the home automation system he just installed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to create the ultimate 3-D home theater experience?  ETC system designers have the experience and the wherewithal to make this dream a reality.  The ETC staff have in-depth knowledge of the industry that  insures this home theater will not only perform but surpass all expectations.</p>
<p>Products ETC recommends to make the “Ultimate 3-D Home Theater” a reality:</p>
<p><strong>Featured Projector</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/3d-projector1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-148 alignnone" title="3d projector" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/3d-projector1.png" alt="" width="200" height="126" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/3d-projector.png"></a>Digital Projection International (DPI) TITAN Reference 1080p-3D  &#8211; Digital Projection International was the first to bring dazzling 3D to elite home cinemas. A truly fulfilling 3D experience must deliver bright, high-resolution and immersive imagery in order to be worthwhile. The TITAN Reference 1080p 3D delivers more brightness to large-screen home theaters than is possible in most commercial theaters! TITAN precision projectors is the only line recognized with TWO Emmy Awards for engineering expertise.  </p>
<p><strong>Featured Screen</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/stewart-screen1.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-149 alignnone" title="stewart screen" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/stewart-screen1-291x300.png" alt="" width="291" height="300" srcset="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/stewart-screen1-291x300.png 291w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/stewart-screen1.png 305w" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/stewart-screen.png"></a>Stewart Filmscreen CineCurve with StudioTek 130 G3 Material, Variable Aspect (screen shape)    55” x 132” (143” diagonal) &#8211; The Stewart projection screen was chosen because they’re capable of displaying the best possible picture—vibrant color, sharp contrast, and rich detail. Studio screening rooms and film production houses trust Stewart screen quality to such an extent that it is the industry standard reference material for color balance, details, and textures.</p>
<p>Many Hollywood blockbusters are produced in Cinemascope format where the movie is 2.35 times wider than it is high. When watching this aspect ratio on a 16:9 screen, 33% of the image appears as black bars.  Because of a special lens on the projector, the CineCurve features a native 2.40:1 image area when watching movies in super-wide screen formats.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker System</strong></p>
<p>Left, Center and Right Speakers: Genelec HT210 Active Loudspeakers, Side and Rear Surround Speakers:  Genelec HT206 Active Loudspeakers, Subwoofers: Genelec HT4 Active Subwoofer &#8211; Since 1978 Genelec has been designing high quality active monitors for broadcast and professional recording applications.  This standard of quality is available for home applications. All Genelec products are <em>active</em>; meaning they include matched amplification, protection circuitry and electronics creating a loudspeaker that achieves greater acoustic output, lower distortion and greater dynamics than a comparable passive speaker. This system will achieve real home theater level output and performance, yet can be easily hidden within a wall unit or behind a screen.</p>
<p><strong>Theater Audio Processor</strong></p>
<p>MOON CP-8 &#8211; This is a true flagship Surround Preamplifier / Processor.  Designed with sound quality first and foremost, it provides a previously unimaginable level of sonic purity and realism from an audio/video product. </p>
<p><strong>Theater Seating</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Leather-chair1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-150 alignnone" title="Leather chair" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Leather-chair1.png" alt="" width="156" height="151" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Leather-chair.png"></a>Acoustic Innovations Contempos in Sophia Leather &#8211; Manufactured in High Point, North Carolina, Acoustic Innovations’ theater seating supplies seating of remarkable craftsmanship, taste and value.  With all steel mechanisms, kiln-dried wood frames, most models are available in various widths and heights to provide the perfect fit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mark your calendar!</strong> <strong> ETC is featured on the December 2 episode of DIY show “The Vanilla Ice Project”</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm" target="_self">ETC</a> was asked to design and install a high-tech <a href="http://www.etc.fm" target="_self">home theater room </a>in the 7,000 square foot Wellington mansion Vanilla Ice is renovating.  Watch how ETC engineers transform a 500 square foot “hidden room” into a cool screening room complete with sound proofing and theater seating.</p>
<p>ETC home theater experts Paul Meola, Andy Madio, Curtis Depew and Michael Squitiro were all on-site completing the various aspects of this <a href="http://www.etc.fm" target="_self">custom home theater project </a> including pre-wire, trim-out, final installation and programming of the system.  Behind the scenes asssiting with design were Ted Bremekamp in engineering, Scott Fitzwater, lighting and the warehouse staff. </p>
<p>“Working on the Vanilla Ice House Project was fun, although a bit challenging when you have two or three camera people hovering over you while you are trying to work.  They asked questions while they were filming and had us re-do parts of the installation over to get it just right for TV.  So much for reality on a “reality” TV show,&#8221; said Squitiro.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-vanilla-ice-project-1286391623.jpg"></a><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-vanilla-ice-project-1286391623.jpg"></a>Vanilla Ice (aka, Rob Van Winkle) is the host of DIY’s Vanilla Ice Project. Best known for his 90’s music, pop- icon Vanilla Ice has over 15 years of home improvement experience.  Watch how he calls the shots in this room-by-room renovation.  The show featuring ETC will air Thursday, December 2 at 9:00 pm on the DIY network.</p>
