				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With lighting controls, <a href="http://www.etc.fm/lighting-control.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can control the lighting</a> in your house with the touch of a button. Gone are the days of pesky light switches and only getting one level of brightness. Let’s take a look at some of the benefits of using lighting controls in West Palm Beach.</p>
<h2>Saves Energy</h2>
<p>Every dimmer automatically saves 4-9% in electricity, even at the highest lighting levels, over a standard on-off switch. When users choose to dim their lights even more <a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/energy-saving-tips/dimmer-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electricity is saved</a>. Basically, the more you dim, the more you save. Traditional light switches don’t give you the ability to dim the lights.</p>
<h2>Saves Money</h2>
<p>Saving energy also results in saving on energy bill costs. Lighting control systems can be set turn on lights according to changes in light or the time of day. This can save money because your lights won’t be running at full strength around the clock.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71958811_m-2015.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-879" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71958811_m-2015-300x210.jpg" alt="How can lighting controls in west palm beach help me?" width="300" height="210" srcset="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71958811_m-2015-300x210.jpg 300w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71958811_m-2015-768x538.jpg 768w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71958811_m-2015.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></h2>
<h2>Extends the Life of the Bulb</h2>
<p>Another way lighting controls can save money is with the actual light bulb itself. With the ability to dim the lights at the touch of a button, you can <a href="https://blog.1000bulbs.com/home/how-to-extend-bulb-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extend the life of the light bulb</a>, thus cutting down on how often you have to replace them.</p>
