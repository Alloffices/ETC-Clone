				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With lighting controls, <a href="http://www.etc.fm/lighting-control.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can control the lighting</a> in your house with the touch of a button. Gone are the days of pesky light switches and only getting one level of brightness. Let’s take a look at some of the benefits of using lighting controls in West Palm Beach.</p>
<h2>Saves Energy</h2>
<p>Every dimmer automatically saves 4-9% in electricity, even at the highest lighting levels, over a standard on-off switch. When users choose to dim their lights even more <a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/energy-saving-tips/dimmer-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electricity is saved</a>. Basically, the more you dim, the more you save. Traditional light switches don’t give you the ability to dim the lights.</p>
<h2>Saves Money</h2>
<p>Saving energy also results in saving on energy bill costs. Lighting control systems can be set turn on lights according to changes in light or the time of day. This can save money because your lights won’t be running at full strength around the clock.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71958811_m-2015.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-879" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71958811_m-2015-300x210.jpg" alt="How can lighting controls in west palm beach help me?" width="300" height="210" srcset="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71958811_m-2015-300x210.jpg 300w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71958811_m-2015-768x538.jpg 768w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71958811_m-2015.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></h2>
<h2>Extends the Life of the Bulb</h2>
<p>Another way lighting controls can save money is with the actual light bulb itself. With the ability to dim the lights at the touch of a button, you can <a href="https://blog.1000bulbs.com/home/how-to-extend-bulb-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extend the life of the light bulb</a>, thus cutting down on how often you have to replace them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology continues to become a routine part of our daily lives. With a home automation system in West Palm Beach FL, you can experience the <a href="http://www.etc.fm/automated-control-system.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benefits of controlling security</a>, lighting and other features on your smartphone. Check out these three benefits of home automation to see how convenient home technology can be.</p>
<h2>#1: Appliance Safety</h2>
<p>We all know that leaving on lights or other appliances can waste energy. However, it can also <a href="https://adjustersinternational.com/common-fire-hazard-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be a safety hazard.</a> With an automation system, you can set a specific time to turn your lights or other appliances off. Additionally, you can use your smartphone to turn off that hair straightener your daughter left on even when you’re away from home. This gives you the power to eliminate appliance hazards, and save energy by controlling lighting in your home.</p>
<h2>#2: Increases Home Security</h2>
<p>Imagine you’re running out the door trying to catch a flight to go on vacation. Did you remember to lock your door? With home automation, you can simply tap your finger and secure your home. No <a href="http://www.kgw.com/article/news/investigations/we-asked-86-burglars-how-they-broke-into-homes/344213396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">need to worry</a> while you’re at work or on vacation. In addition, you can receive alerts if your home is entered. This ensures that your children are home from school safely, and you are aware of who enters your home at all times.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71948787_m-2015.jpg"><img class="wp-image-868 size-medium aligncenter" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71948787_m-2015-300x210.jpg" alt="Where can I find the best home automation system in West Palm Beach FL?" width="300" height="210" srcset="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71948787_m-2015-300x210.jpg 300w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71948787_m-2015-768x538.jpg 768w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Depositphotos_71948787_m-2015.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>It is the time of year for lights!</strong>  Lights on trees, lights on homes, lights on boats&#8230;. the list goes on and on.</p>
<p><strong>Adding festive fun to you home has never been easier</strong> when you have an automated system to set the scene and turn the decorative lights on and off at designated times.  Not forgetting to turn the outside lights off before you go to bed.  And for inside, the holiday lights scene can be scheduled to go on early in the morning, off during the day and on again in early evening.  Nothing to remember if you are out late shopping or getting ready to entertain.  The lights and decorations are taken care of.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/holiday-lights.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-819" alt="holiday lights" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/holiday-lights.jpg" width="290" height="173" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Another way your automated system can help you make the season fun is through music.</strong>  Your doorbell chime can be scheduled to play jingle bells starting the Monday after Thanksgiving.  You can also set holiday music to play throughout your house every morning throughout December to ensure everyone enjoys the spirit of the season.</p>
<p><strong>These are just a few ways that automation can make the holiday season fun and easy.</strong>  If you are looking for more ways to brighten your home, give us a call.  We are happy to help.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>We are all striving to use less energy and do our part, especially in our homes.</strong>  It would be wonderful if we could easily have net-zero energy homes, but that is still many years away. For now, we can do a few things to control the energy we use, and use less of it every day. Although the materials used to construct your home can make a difference to your energy consumption, the technology and what you do on the inside is what matters in the long term.</p>

<p><strong></strong><strong>Automated And Integrated Control Systems</strong></p>
<p><strong>The key to success in your home is using technology to maximize efficiency –</strong> making things more energy efficient and managing the energy you use.  Having one control system that integrates all the different technology in your home makes it easy to be eco-friendly.</p>
<p>The control systems available today are so intuitive that children and guests can use them without looking at a manual or having to endure a lengthy explanation.  And you can do so much more than just turn things on and off.  Using a system that interfaces with your iPhone, iPad or tablet, you can dim lights, manage multiple room systems like TV’s or audio, climate control, motorized shades, landscape lighting, the pool system, and security &#8211; from home or anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>For example, as you leave your home to go out for the evening, you can press one button that says “Away” and the security system is activated and all the lights in the home turn off.  This not only saves the time of going room to room to shut lights off, it also saves energy, because no lights are left on by mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>In addition to making energy management easy, home technology integration also makes monitoring energy use simple.  You can see real time energy consumption for your entire home day by day, down to each outlet in the home. TV’s, appliances, phone chargers, DVD players, game consoles, and the like, quietly consume energy 24 hours a day.  Being able to see a picture of your home and where the energy is being used can give you the information needed to cut unnecessary energy use.</p>
<p><strong>Integrating your home technology not only makes life easier, it saves you money as well!</strong>  ETC specializes in home technology integration, helping more than 2,000 clients in 25 years.  We have the experience to make sure you have the right systems in place to fit your lifestyle, and you save energy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Looking into updating your home to take full advantage of the latest technology that helps make life a bit simpler?</strong>  Planning to build a home and want to have your security system integrated with the automated lighting system and a family room that turns into home theater at the touch of a button?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/crestron_TSW_550_med.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-542" title="crestron_TSW_550_med" src="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/crestron_TSW_550_med-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/crestron_TSW_550_med-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.etc.fm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/crestron_TSW_550_med.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Before you meet with a custom electronics professional, the people that make all the magic happen, it pays to have a little knowledge of the industry before you start. </strong> Like in any new endeavor, cooking, sailing, or golf lessons, it pays to know the lingo, and home automation is no different.</p>
<p>Lisa Montgomery, a writer for Electronic House magazine, compiled a great list of the “10 Most Misunderstood Terms” used by the pros.  Read over this list so you will have a better idea of what you will be discussing.</p>
<p><strong>1. Macro:</strong> A macro is a very good thing to have. It allows you to touch one button to initiate multiple commands to a variety of different devices rather than pecking at several individual buttons to accomplish the same task. Macros can set the lights, music and thermostats in the dining room for a dinner party, arrange the environment for a movie in the home theater … anything else that would typically require the adjustment of several devices through a variety of controls.</p>
<p><strong>2. GUI:</strong> Short for Graphic User Interface. The term refers to any type of device that’s used control the electronic devices in your home. A GUI can be an iPhone, an iPad, a touch panel, a remote control or something else.</p>
<p><strong>3. Scenes:</strong> A scene is much like a macro, but it a term used mainly when describing how a group of light fixtures responds to a single command from a remote, touch panel, etc. A lighting scene could involve the brightening and dimming of several fixtures in a room to evoke a mood like romantic, party or evening drama, or to complement a certain activity like breakfast, goodnight or welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>4. Architectural:</strong> In the custom electronics industry, architectural commonly refers to a type of loudspeaker; specifically, one that can be mounted flush with the wall or ceiling surface.</p>
<p><strong>5. Acoustically Transparent:</strong> This term usually refers to a type of screen sometimes used in a home theater or media room. It is designed to display images projected onto it from a video projector, but unlike other projection screens its fabric has tiny, indiscernible holes that allow sound from speakers positioned behind it to filter unaffected into the room. They are a popular choice of homeowners who want a clean, uncluttered look in their home theaters.</p>
<p><strong>6. Bright:</strong> When an installer says a room is “bright,” he means that there may be too many hard surfaces (wood floors, windows, marble countertops, etc.) for an audio system to perform its best. Sound that’s broadcast from speakers in a bright room can bounce harshly off the hard surfaces, making it difficult to hear dialogue in a movie or understand the lyrics of a song. A custom electronics pro can solve this issue by adding soft materials (draperies, rugs or special acoustical treatments) to the room.</p>
<p><strong>7. Presets:</strong> Most home automation systems must be programmed by a professional to react in a certain way when they receive a signal from something – a timer, a button press, a motion sensor, etc. This cause-and-effect process is what’s known as a preset. For example, your CE pro might program a preset that tells the home automation system to open the motorized drapes at a certain time of day.</p>
<p><strong>8. Scalable:</strong> A “scalable” automation system is one that can be easily reconfigured (usually to perform additional tasks) to meet the needs of its users. Scalability is a feature you should always look for in an automation system.</p>
<p><strong>9. Compatible:</strong> When you’re compatible with someone, you just naturally “mesh.” The same is true of a home automation system and the many diverse components it can control. In the home technology, manufacturers and custom electronics professional strive for as much compatibility between products as possible. Sometimes this is accomplished by the manufacturer; other times, the CE pro finds a way to get two incompatible components to communicate openly with each other. When all parts of a system are compatible, it typically works better and is easier to use.</p>
<p><strong>10. Integration:</strong> This is the process of making all elements of a home automation system working together seamlessly, as though they were one unit. When a custom electronics professional says he specialized in “integration” (many of them do), he will know how to tie new components into your old whole-house music system or make your home’s thermostats work with the home automation system he just installed.</p>
