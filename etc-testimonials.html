<p class="testi-text">Dear Bill:<br />
<br />
I am writing this letter in recognition of ETC&rsquo;s efforts on the audio and visual design, development and construction of our new fitness, tennis and aquatic capital improvement project. It is with great pride and pleasure that I recommend ETC as Aberdeen Golf &amp; Country Club&rsquo;s preferred audio and visual specialist. <br />
<br />
When I was first introduced to ETC, I shared that my objectives were to implement several trendsetting and innovative approaches into our new fitness tennis and aquatics facility.  I would like to commend Louis Gelb and Mike Cogbill for not only meeting but exceeding my expectations. Mike&rsquo;s passion does not justify nor depict the manner in which he always became the catalyst through which all efforts were channeled. He not only provided exceptional leadership, but went above and beyond in his normal course of duties striving to make whatever I wanted the best it could be. <br />
<br />
Mike embraced all challenges presented to him with enthusiasm and thoroughness and most importantly, with a positive &ldquo;can do&rdquo; attitude. His attention to detail is exceptional and I recognized, in a short period of time, that his reliability, focus, and due diligence were always instrumental in achieving the goals and objectives of the team. <br />
<br />
Leadership is the cornerstone from which to build, and your commitment to excellence by having individuals such as Louis and Mike on your team of professionals has eloquently transcended my visions into reality.  <br />
<br />
ETC exemplifies the standard from which all audio/visual companies should be compared and it is without hesitation and great pride that I recommend ETC to any other organization.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,</p>

<p class="testi-text">&quot;I could go on forever about them. I thought they were terrific. They have a great product and are very easy to work with. They listened to exactly what I wanted and answered all my questions. I&acute;m a pretty technically oriented person myself, but they were able to explain things in layman&acute;s terms to my wife. They took asincere interest in what systems I wanted to have in my house, and they tailored systems that would fit my budget and could do what I wanted them to do. Now we seldom reach for light switches; it&acute;s like the system adapts to us. We can easily select the type of music we often listen to now from easy-to-use touchscreens. I wouldn&acute;t want to live without a system like that anymore.&quot;</p>

<p class="testi-text">&quot;We had our system installed (by ETC) when we had our house built about six years ago. Since then, we&acute;ve enhanced it, and the whole system works very well. We have been very impressed with it. It has a lot of great features that you don&acute;t get anywhere else. In general, it&acute;s just a very convenient system. We already have recommended ETC to others. We have friends who are building homes who have bought ETC systems. They talked to Bill (Maronet) and then they talked with us, and we were able to assure them that everything Bill said he could do he would do. We liked Bill&acute;s forthrightness. He was very honest with us and was very helpful in all his explanations of what was available. They were very innovative and had very good follow-up, and they showed a lot of attention to detail. They exceeded my expectations, and I would recommend ETC to others. I have talked with other people in the field who are some of ETC&acute;s competitors, and I&acute;ve found that ETC is the best in the business.&quot;</p>

<div class="left-quote">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="testi-text">&quot;My wife and I are so pleased with how the systems that ETC installed for us have made our live easier and more enjoyable. We rarely used to listen to music and now that it is so easy to operate with Crestron, we almost always have it on. My wife Cheryl is constantly adding to her CD music collection and is enjoying it immensely. We also get a lot of pleasure from our media room and find watching movies a real &quot;experience&quot; now. We were afraid that we would get all &quot;this stuff&quot; and not use it but it has been the opposite. We do use the systems and they have greatly improved the quality of our lives. With the combined Security and Lighting control we feel safer in our new home. ETC has done a wonderful job simplifying our systems operation so that even we can easily use them.&quot;</p>
